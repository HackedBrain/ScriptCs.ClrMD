# ScriptCS.ClrMD

This is a [ScriptCS](http://github.com/scriptcs/scriptcs) script pack that brings in features 
of the ClrMD API which can then be used for scripted or interactive diagnostics (via REPL) 
against any running CLR process.


# What is ClrMD?

For an introduction to ClrMD and its API you can [check out this blog post](http://blogs.msdn.com/b/dotnet/archive/2013/05/01/net-crash-dump-and-live-process-inspection.aspx) on [the .NET Framework Blog](http://blogs.msdn.com/b/dotnet/).

# Getting Started with the ClrMD Script Pack
